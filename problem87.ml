(*# P87 (**) Depth-first order graph traversal (alternative solution)
# 
# Write a predicate that generates a depth-first order graph traversal sequence.
# The starting point should be specified, and the output should be a list of
# nodes that are reachable from this starting point (in depth-first order).*)
