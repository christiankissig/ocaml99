(*# P86 (**) Node degree and graph coloration
# 
# a) Write a predicate degree(Graph,Node,Deg) that determines the degree of a
# given node.
# 
# b) Write a predicate that generates a list of all nodes of a graph sorted
# according to decreasing degree.
# 
# c) Use Welch-Powell's algorithm to paint the nodes of a graph in such a way
# that adjacent nodes have different colors.*)
